In the end of 2018, me and Omer Sadika started exploring Istio and canary release, with the goal of building a product that will make canary releases with Istio practical and approachable. After a few months of market research (CI/CD and DevOps) and technology research (Istio, Kubernetes, Go) we decided to conclude the venture due to lack of product/market fit. This repo contains the website we stood up that includes the product vision and the foudational artical on the concept of Continuous Release.
